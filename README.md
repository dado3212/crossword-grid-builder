I've been getting into crossword constructing, but found the initial process staring at a blank 15x15 grid to be one of my least favorite parts. This tool allows you to build a grid by leveraging all of the grid patterns for all NYTimes puzzles ever, in a heatmap. As you place black squares into the grid it will update the heatmap to only show grids that include those black squares (though ideally you should diverge from history: 70% of puzzle grids have never been used before).

This is currently live at https://alexbeals.com/projects/crossword/. It works for all days of the week, along with all NYTimes puzzles from the very first puzzle in 1942 up to today's puzzle (currently June 3, 2024 until I update the code to automatically add new ones).
